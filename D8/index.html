        <ul>
          <li>Developed face recognition solution for Honeywell’s Video Analytics. My work included experimenting with various libraries and training them with numerous images of peoples face. I had used pre-trained models from various companies and
            compare its accuracy which involved testing under different lighting conditions. Apart from this I had worked on skin color detection required to mask people face for General Data Protection Regulation.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Worked as a software developer for Avionics applications which are used for simulating test cases like flying, landing, and communication between ground station and aircraft.</li>
          <li>Worked on Test Document automation Application which eliminated thousands of hours of manual work involving preparing test reports. Implemented sentimental analysis using NLTK library, which tells the overall tone of the report
            generated. Used textBlob to show the percentage of positive, negative and neutral responses from the reviewers. The application improved the cycle time by 50% and reduced their manual Non-engineering efforts by 80% which saved 50k/year.

Underwent the final year project guided by Dr Kiran Beiley, Professor in BMSCE, this project aims at
designing a SoC Peripherals – Timers and Counters with parameterized Frequency. Verification and
Validation was completed in FPGA Environment. The Design was used to demonstrate Traffic Life
Controlling by combining Virtuoso FPGA board with Arduino Board.</li>
