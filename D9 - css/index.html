          <h2>VISUAL CREATIVITY</h2>
          <p>There's more visual freedo in parallax website design. Rather than focussing on block style information architecture, you can create refreshing and engaging visuals such as animations or beautiful photography, that act as a continuum, ultimately inspiring users to scroll further down the page</p>

          <h1>SLOWER LOAD TIMES</h1>
          <p>50% of website users bounce off the page if it hasnt loaded in 3-5 seconds. So the more high resolution imager and animations you include, the longer it takes to load the page. When writing this article, we tested some popular parallax websites, and found that ones with complex visuals took up to 30 seconds to load on a mobile device, whereas simple and minimalist long-scroll websites loaded within a few seconds</p>
