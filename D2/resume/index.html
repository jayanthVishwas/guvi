    <h3>WORK EXPERIENCE</h3>
    <p><b class="color">Honeywell Technology Solutions, Bangalore, India</b></p>
    <p><b>Senior Software Engineer, Video Analytics</b> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed face recognition solution for Honeywell’s Video Analytics. My work included experimenting
        with various libraries and training them with numerous images of peoples face. I had used pre-trained
        models from various companies and compare its accuracy which involved testing under different lighting
        conditions. Apart from this I had worked on skin color detection required to mask people face for
        General Data Protection Regulation. </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Software Engineer, Avionics Tools & Tech (ATT)</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Worked as a software developer for Avionics applications which are used for simulating test cases like
        flying, landing, and communication between ground station and aircraft.</li>
      <li>Worked on Test Document automation Application which eliminated thousands of hours of manual
work involving preparing test reports. Implemented sentimental analysis using NLTK library, which tells
the overall tone of the report generated. Used textBlob to show the percentage of positive, negative and
neutral responses from the reviewers. The application improved the cycle time by 50% and reduced their
manual Non-engineering efforts by 80% which saved 50k/year. </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>PROJECT WORK AND RELEVANT FIELD EXPERIENCE</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/vishwasjayanth45/breast-cancer-eda">Breast Cancer Classification:</a> Performed an Exploratory Data Analysis and feature extraction to find
the best features for the model to classify the cancer as malign or benign. Experimented with various
models</li>
<li><b>SoC Peripheral Design – Timers and Counters with parameterized Frequency</b>
Underwent the final year project guided by Dr Kiran Beiley, Professor in BMSCE, this project aims at
designing a SoC Peripherals – Timers and Counters with parameterized Frequency. Verification and
Validation was completed in FPGA Environment. The Design was used to demonstrate Traffic Life
Controlling by combining Virtuoso FPGA board with Arduino Board.</li>
